# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to compile enough data to support my friend Kate and my decision to start a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. I will need to create a proposal to present to an angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to help start the program.


The following link will take you to my Tableau dashbboard where all of my data visualizations for this project are.
